		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assetsâ€”usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity. ABS are financial securities backed by income-generating assets such as credit card receivables, home equity loans, student loans, and auto loans. Pooling assets into an ABS is a process called securitization. One difference between an ABS and a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is that the CDO issuer is generally a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or trust.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Asset-backed securities, for example home equity loans (HEL), credit cards, and so forth are backed by receivables [payments] that are either secured (such as HEL) or unsecured (for example, credit cards). They are typically tranched based on default risk.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A CDO tranche becomes liable for losses when the total amount of defaults or losses in the underlying debt pool exceeds a certain threshold, called the attachment point. The attachment point is expressed as a percentage of the total value of the debt pool. In other words, the attachment point is the level of subordination above which a given tranche stands. Note that the notion of &apos;liability for loss&apos; is in a financial or econonmic sense rather than a legal sense.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The higher the attachment point, the lower the risk and the return for the tranche. The lower the attachment point, the higher the risk and the return for the tranche. The most senior tranches have the highest attachment points and are paid first from the cash flows of the debt pool. The most junior tranches have the lowest attachment points and are paid last from the cash flows of the debt pool. The junior tranches also bear the first losses when defaults occur in the debt pool.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

Understanding prepayment speed is critical in assessing the value of mortgage pass-through securities. Prepayment models are based on mathematical equations and usually involve the analysis of historical prepayment trends to predict what will happen in the future. Prepayment models are often used to value mortgage pools such as GNMA securities or other securitized debt products, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS).</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

For ABS you don&apos;t know this so you have to get this information from the loan servicer. Investopedia explains Weighted Average Coupon - WAC For example, suppose a MBS is composed of two different pools of mortgages: $6 million worth of mortgages that yield 7.5% and a pool of $4 million mortgages that yield 5%. The WAC would be 6.5%. The WAC on a mortgage-backed security is an important piece of information used by analysts to estimate the pre-pay characteristics of that security. It is an important relative value tool in MBS portfolio management and analysis.</skos:editorialNote>
		<cmns-av:abbreviation xml:lang="en">WAC</cmns-av:abbreviation>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The weighted average coupon (WAC) is calculated by taking the gross of the interest rates owed on the underlying mortgages of the MBS and weighting them according to the percentage of the security that each mortgage represents. The WAC represents the average interest rate of different pools of mortgages with varying interest rates. In the weighted average calculation, the principal balance of each underlying mortgage is used as the weighting factor. To calculate the WAC, the coupon rate of each mortgage or MBS is multiplied by its remaining principal balance. The results are added together, and the sum total is divided by the remaining balance. A mortgage-backed security&apos;s current WAC can differ from its original WAC as the underlying mortgages pay down at different speeds. In the weighted-average calculation, the principal balance of each underlying mortgage is used as the weighting factor.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Average life is calculated using the weighted average time to the receipt of all future cash flows of an amortizing loan or amortizing bond. it&apos;s the average time until a dollar of principal is repaid.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The time weightings used in weighted average life calculations are based on payments to the principal. In many loans, such as mortgages, each payment consists of payments to principal and payments to interest. In WAL, only the principal payments are considered and these payments tend to get larger over time, with early payments of a mortgage going mostly to interest, while payments made towards the end of the loan are applied mostly to the principal balance of the loan.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Where it refers to pre-payment above, if the bond does not include prepayment then this is not included. However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant. It is not relevant for other types of bond where e.g. you would use yield to next call, yield to worst etc. Average Life used in place of Maturity for Yield Calculation. This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it&apos;s a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect. Sinking Fund: Each payment is part principal and part interest, this is implicit in the overall definition of &quot;Early payment&quot;.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A weighted average loan age (WALA) may apply to pool-backed securities such as Ginnie Mae or Freddie Mac securities. The WALA is measured as the time in months since the origination of the loans, with the weighting based on each loan&apos;s size in proportion to the aggregate total of the pool.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This is defined by the issuer. WALA is more official, not an analysis from a vendor. This changes but the values are relayed by the issuer on an ongoing basis. Investopedia explains Weighted Average Loan Age - WALA The weighted average age will change over time as some mortgages get paid off faster than others. Based on the issuer of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the WALA may be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure, or the beginning notional value of the loan. The flip side of the WALA is the weighted average maturity (WAM), which is a dollar-weighted measure of the months remaining until the principal amounts are completely repaid on each loan in the pool.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:abbreviation xml:lang="en">WAM</cmns-av:abbreviation>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The measure is calculated by totaling each mortgage value represented by the MBS. The weights of each mortgage is found by dividing the value of each into the total of all. To arrive at the WAM number the weight of each security is multiplied by the time until maturity of each mortgage, and then all the values are added together. For example say an MBS has three mortgages valued at $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 (a total of $6,000) and mature in one, two and three years respectively. The weights of these are 1/6 (1,000/6,000), 1/3 (2,000/6,000) and 1/2 (3,000/6,000). The WAM is 2 1/3 years (1/6 x 1 year + 1/3 x 2 years + 1/2 x 3 years). Note that this calculation would need to be adjusted if there are multiple pools behind the MBS.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This term is used more broadly to describe maturities in a portfolio of debt securities, including corporate debt and municipal bonds. The higher the WAM, the longer it takes for all of the mortgages or bonds in the portfolio to mature. WAM is used to manage debt portfolios and to assess the performance of debt portfolio managers.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
